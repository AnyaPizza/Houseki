![Pinku Ore](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/dec73fb10c4d6e8aace48495d79382edacdebf76.png)
  
Pinku is the only ore in the mod that is made up. This ore was the first ore added to the mod as a tester, and I just couldn't remove it, so it stays! But this is the only exception!

### Where to find
Pinku Ore is extremely rare! It can only be found in The End and is usually found in clumps of 1-3. 
It will drop as a block and must be smelted to get a Pinku Shard. You need 4 Shards to craft 1 Pinku

![Pinku Recipe](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/ee9ccc7ccfde8ff348535f31e820616f130f0701.png)

Once you have a Pinku, you can then use it to upgrade Netherite Armor in a Smithing Table using a Pinku Upgrade Template.

![Pinku Upgrade Recipe](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/f04149c60535009725061cf9725be456a55c99d7.png)

The Pinku Upgrade Template can not be duplicated and can be found in Ancient Cities and End Cities. It can only be given as a reward in Trial Chambers.

Pinku can be given to you as a drop after defeating the Warden.
Pinku Shards can be found in Ancient Cities, Bastions, Buried Treasure, End Cities, and Woodland Mansions. They can also be given as a reward from Trial Chambers and a drop from defeating the Warden.

Pinku is a bit better than Netherite, maybe a bit overpowered...

Pinku also comes with Horse armor and Nautilus Armor (Nautilus Armor is only available after 1.21.11)
